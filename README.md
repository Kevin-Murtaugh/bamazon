UCF Full Stack Bootcamp Week 6 homework, Node.js, npm inquirer, mySQL, DB query

This was an exercise to demonstrate node.js, JavaScript & mySQL. Node required
“mySQL” library to accommodate database manipulation and “inquirer” to generate
console output and accept console input.

The logic for handling and tracking items, inventory & prices was fairly
straightforward. In order to smooth out development and testing of the code,
data validation was left until the end. While this code 100% meets the stated
requirements, there is still room for improvement. A prime area for this
improvement would require multiple additional inquirer.prompts and promises.
Given a more leisurely deadline (or maybe after the bootcamp is over), these can
be constructed and applied to improve the professionalism of the solution.

The mySQL portion of this exercise was the highlight for me as I feel my
background in engineering, mathematics and statistics –on top of this bootcamp
–will combine to make me capable not only of building and managing databases but
also ready and able to determine if and how the data can be applied to generate
meaningful (and therefore monetizable) conclusions from this data.

The repo for all the code is fully up to date now. Videos suitable for
demonstrating functionality will soon follow.
